# AIDL-Server-Client

##### Source and clarifications: https://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl

Scenario: There are 2 applications, the server app and the client app. We'll call them AidlServer and AidlClient. The server app contains a service which can do Math operations, called MathService (or MyService). The client app wants to use the complicated math methods that are implemented in this Service, which is located on the server. This is what we are going to try to do.


___

We'll start with the AidlServer.
## 1.  The aidl file

In the _project_ structure of your current project, go to **app/src/main**, Right Click on **main** > New > AIDL > AIDL File.  Create the MathManager.aidl file and its methods. The aidl file will generate the required interface that both the client application and the server will be using.
```aidl
interface IMathManager {
    int add(in int x, in int y);
    int substract(in int x, in int y);
}
```

Now, after rebuilding the project, you should have in the Android project structure, in the **java *(generated)*** folder the IMathManager interface. Since it has been generated by the Android framework, we won't be modifying anything here. Notice however the Stub abstract class inside it. That is what we'll be using to communicate between processes.

## 2.  The Service
